# Robust_Lasso_ElasticNet

PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE REPO TO BE ABLE TO READ THE RENDERED .HTML FILES - apparently, GitHub makes it difficult to download individual files from a repo, and GitHub Pages seems to remove practical features I intentionally coded into the files.

A series of R functions and workbooks for implementing robust lasso and elastic net methods. Includes a script for simulating regression data, the individual components to run a combined-model approach, a full workbook for implementing a combined-model approach for lay researchers, and a full workbook for quantitatively-oriented researchers to use for research/simulation purposes.

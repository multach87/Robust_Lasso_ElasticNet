# Robust_Lasso_ElasticNet

PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE REPO TO BE ABLE TO READ THE RENDERED .HTML FILES - apparently, GitHub makes it difficult to download individual files from a repo, and some URL-prepension tools which will render the .html files remove some practical features I coded into the corresponding .Rmd files. Also, it's less than 70mb!

A series of R functions and workbooks for implementing robust lasso and elastic net methods. Includes a script for simulating regression data, the individual components to run a combined-model approach, a full workbook for implementing a combined-model approach for lay researchers, and a full workbook for quantitatively-oriented researchers to use for research/simulation purposes.
